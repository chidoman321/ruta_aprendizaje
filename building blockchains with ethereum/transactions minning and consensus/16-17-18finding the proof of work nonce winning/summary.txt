in a block we have the merklet hash of the block
-previos hash block
-other metadata
-and the proof of work nonce

all this information goes through a hash funtcion 
the requirement is that the result must be less than a targer-hash value , and this means
the proof of work  should satisfy this condition

generate a new block require 
- the hash of all transaction represented by the merkle root
-the hash of the previos block
-other metadate
-proof of work nonce

after win
    once the node found the nonce , wil broadcast to the rest of the nodes once verified
    miner claims the reward , if some node doesnt accept it , it will lose the chance to claim 
    new reawrds

beyond proof of work
    if someone has the  control of >51 of nodes , he can emit and verify fraudulent transactions
    ,other issue with pow , is that every miner is seeking the  nonce, wastes tremendous amount of
    energy
proof of stake
    meant to be less vulnerable to centralization 
    details of this are beyond this course

allow multiple parties to iniate transactions
no need central authority
