an essential step to verify a transaction is verify the sender identity
when a transaction is iniated it first goes to a unconfirmed pool  where nodes take  transactions
and verfiy them before adding them  to their blocks

-the node need to verify the integrity of the transaction 
-confirm that the sender have the assets he is trying to transfer
-and the transaction nonce

many transaction may be broadcast simultaneously ,and all the nodes need to agree with the order
of transactions via algorithm consensus

how the nodes can verfiy the identity of the account each account on the ethereum network contains
a pair of keys
-private key in analogy this will be your (atm pin)
-public key in analogy this will be your card number

in a transaction the account need to add the 
-signed transaction 
-raw transaction 

in the sender side there is an encrypt function 
in the recipient side there is an decrypt functon

sender side
private key + transaction hash + encrypt function = signed transaction 

recipient side
public key + signed transaction + hashin function  = transaction hash
raw transaction + hash function = transaction hash

if the transaction hash output are the same the transaction is verified

public blockchain network ,anyone can join , lots of nodes , is slow to all nodes consensus
private network entry is restricted , and you must meet the criteria to join in fewer nodes,
is fast to all nodes consensus

to be sure that the sender have enough assets to cover the  fee and the send of assets , each node
have a database state
