the first service is a ?? to authenticate when 

compute -> ec2 -> pair key
network ->vpc ->elastic

allocation id=eipalloc-042d05216534d7205

vpc = virtual private cloud

to communicate vpc with ec2 , we use a internet gateway


an availability zone will ha ve inside a  public subnet and a private subnet
we will make a public subnet inside vpc as well a private subnet

ecs will deploy a docker container cluster , which will contain the nodes and miners , and the ethstats
the eth explorer also

the template will also include load balancers on each public subnet
