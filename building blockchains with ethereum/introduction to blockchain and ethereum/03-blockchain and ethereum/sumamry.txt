we should now explore some of the basics concepts which underline ethereum to begin
with what ethereum is , it can be defined as an open source and public blockchain based platform
which supports the concepts of smart contracts, so what exactly are the smart contracts we can think it
as a mechanism which allows common contractual clauses to be defined,verified and even enforced
even if all the participants in the contract do not trust each other and there is no trusted third
party who can mediate between the participants of the contract

another thing ?one? needs to be familiar with when you think ethereum , is its cryptocurrency
which is known as ether, now ether is the currency which all nodes which make up the ethereum network
maybe compensated for their participation the ?owners? of this nodes can then go ahead and exchange
the ether cryptocurrency for any of the regular currencies such as us dolars or euros at the time 
of this recording the value of one ether was about 200 us dollars on the currency exchange markets

the ethereum virtual machine  is an execution environment which all of the nodes participating, in 
the ethereum network need to be  able to run  in order to execute  the smart contracts, smart contracts
as we should soon see are essentially pieces of code which require the ethereum virtual machine in order
to be executed we move along now to one definiton of a blockchain which can be thought ?off? as
a growing list of records which are know as  blocks  and these blocks happend to be link together
cryptographicly, let us examine parts of this definition in a ?? detail , a blockchain is made up
of a number of records which are essentially the blocks  of the blockchain and to be precise it is
a list of records which make ?it? very similar to a ledger which is used in accounting, this ledger is
is an open one which means that there are new records which are constantly added to the ledger,
and this ledger is open in more ways than one , in that every participant in this blockchain peer to
peer network has the ability to view the contents of the ledger and if it meets certain conditions 
is also able to write to it as we should soon see , this ledger is not  a centralized one  and in
fact distributed across all the nodes in the network this distributed ledger need not be stored in it's 
entirely on any single node of the blockchain network however between all  the nodes the entirely
ldeger should  be recoverable if needed, so let us summarize what a blockchain is in essence it is
an open  and distributed ledger whichs contains  a number of  records which are know as  blocks , all
this blocks are arranged in the form of a list and within each of these blocks are sequence of
transactions,it is not required for any indiviudal node in the blockhain network to store the full content
of the ledger however it is posible  to recover the entire ledger from the network as a whole, the 
transactions which are stored on a blockchain are ?coomon? can not be altered, the blocks which make 
up the blockchain are all link together cryptographicly in that each block is linked to the block inmidiately
preceding  it ?there by ? ensuring ?? all the blocks within blockchain as result it is almost 
impossible for a node to unilaterally change a transaction after the fact as this would brake the 
cryptographic link between the blocks  the result of this  is that the transactions in a blockchain 
are all verifiable so if someone  has try  altered a transaction after the fact , then the cryptographicly
link  in the blockcahin will be broken  an others will be able to confirm  that a transaction has 
been  ??    identify this transaction as well
