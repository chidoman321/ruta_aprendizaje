we move along now and take a look at the accounts and in ethereum  we start off with the
concept of a centralized ledger where you have a single leger which can be  access by multiple 
parties, represented here by the nodes A,B,C and D and you'll notice that the access is two way,
that is this nodes can both read from the central ledger  and also write to it moving along we
now take a look  at  a distributed ledger where all this nodes share the same ledger however ,
each of them maintains  their own copy  of it  in order to ensure  that each ?? individual copies 
are in sync with the rest this nodes will need  to conmunicate with each other ,in a blockchain
network this share ledger is in fact a ?chain ? of interconnected blocks  which make up  the blockchain
in order  to keep the indiviual  blockcahins in sync with the rest of the network each of this participants
will need  to conmunicate with each other so when we have  a number of particapnts which are interconnected
and operating on their own copy  of a share blockchain  we have a blockchain network and each of the
indiviual participant  in this blockchain network , are know as  nodes, so let us examine the nodes
in a ethereum blockchain network , so each of the nodes needs to run  the ethereum  virtual machine
or evm which is a runtime enviorment, which is responsible for executing  the code in us smart contract
this nodes will also need to be able to calculate the complexity of a transaction  in terms of the gas
consumption  this is a concept which  we'll explore in depth later in the course and finally ethereum
nodes should also ba able to verify individual transactions once again  will be examin in ?? depth 
later on . now that we have taked a look at nodes  in a blockcahin network  we move on  ot ethereum
account in ethereum will belogn  to either a sender or a recipient in a transaction  and in fact
all ethereum  transactions are initiated from  ethereum  accounts , accounts in ethereum can be  of
two types the first one is an externally owned account "eoas"  and the second one ?being? a contract
account , let us examine each of these in a little more detail  so externally owned accounts are one
which posses some sort of balance in the form of ether which is the cryptocurrency of ethereum this
eoas are capable  of iniat transaction  on the ethereum network and each account  posses a pair
of keys one being a private key and the other being a public key which are used to encrypt and
decrypt one factor in which externally owned accounts differ from  the contract accounts is that 
there is no  code associated with eoas noving along contract accounts much like eoas they also posses
a balance in the form of ether and can also  fire transactions however contact accounts have some
smart contracts code which associated with it and this  code can be ?trriger? by transactions all 
by messages which are initiated by other contracts the function  of contract accounts in ethereum 
is to perform  operatons  from  ?some ? smart contracts when  they are executed

**nodes
-evm responsible for running our smart cotnract 
-calculate complexity
-verify transactions 

**account
-each account in ethereum will belong to a sender or a recipient
-all transaction are iniated from accounts
-there are two types of accounts externally acounts and contract account
-eoas have a balance, they can execute transacions, each have a pair of keys private/public key, there is no code associated
.contract accounts , it have a balance, can trigger transactions,associated code which is triggered and can execute operations
