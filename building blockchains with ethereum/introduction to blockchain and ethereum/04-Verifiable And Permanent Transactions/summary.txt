an essential feature of ethereum are any blockchain implementation for that matter is that
transactions within are ?both? verifiable and ?permanent? verifiable meaning that if the transaction
has been tampered in any way  it can be easily detected  and permanent meaning that ?if? the transaction
has been written to the blockchain  it can not be  altered afterwards the mechanism used to achieve
this features is the cryptographic link between all the blocks  in the blockchain so each block 
consist  of a 

-"hash"cryptographic hash of the previous block
-"tiemstamp"along with a timestamp
-"data"as well as an ordered list of transactions  for the current block 

as result of  this  the trasaction data in any block  can not be modified after the block has been 
written , this is because any modification  to a transaction ?will? afect the cryptographic hash
of the block it is a ?part ? of , and since this hash  is part of the next block  in the blockchain
that block will also  change so the only  way  a particular node can altered transactions after it  
is been written ?? consensus from the other nodes in the network and this is extremely complicated
so the result of this  cryptographic link  is that  each transaction in the blockchain  is both 
verifiable and permanet , so we have seen  the definition of a blockchain but we described as a 
growing list  of records of blocks  which are linked together cryptographicly  and nased on what  
we have just covered we can also define a blockchain , as an open  and distributed ledger
which can record transactions in a ?? which can record transactions  in a manner which both verifiable
and permanent it is an open ledger because transaction keep getting added to it and the ledger keeps
growing and it is distributed because it is spread across multiple nodes in a blockchain network
and thanks to the cryptographic link between  the blocks and the blockchain  the transactions
written ?in the? blockchain  are both verifiable and permanent
