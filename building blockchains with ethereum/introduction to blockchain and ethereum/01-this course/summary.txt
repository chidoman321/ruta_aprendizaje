hi and welcome to this course building blochchain with ethereum

you will undestard blockchain technology and develop smart contracts on the ethereum platform
there are many ?ways? to describe blochchain technology and here is a good one blockchain is x digital
ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to ?record? not just financial transactions
but ?wothly? anything of value , the blochchain platform such as building descentralized application
no longer needs a background in cryptography , mathematics or even very complex programming ,ethereum
provides all the tools needed for you get up and running ?with you? smart contracts very quicly amazon
web services offers blockchains templates ?which? allow you to construct your ?own? ethereum network or
set up ethereum nodes that ?will? connect you to the ?main? production network, all this in no time at 
all in this course we start off by understanding what exactly blochchain is and why ?? is used to construct
distributed ledgers ?we'll? see how blockchain technology can be used to store a distributed ledger of
inmutable and verifyable transactions ,?will? the basics of the ethereum ?? concepts such as accounts,
nondes,transactions,?minus?, gas and proof of worrk ?we'll,will? then use blockchain templates on aws
to build ?an ? ethereum network and configure a bastion host,proxies server to connect to this ethereum
networks that we can run smart contracts and finally we use solidity programming languaje to build a smart contract
?for ? voting in election , this course requires that you're comfortable programming in some high level
programming languaje python or java and comfortable working  with cloud computing platforms such as 
aws, azure or  gcp, developers who are looking to learn about blockchain its application and who want to
work with the ethereum frmework for building descentralized apps ?other? ones for xx this couse is best suited
