we begin this course by going over some of the broad range topics which should be covered

we will begin with some of the basics of blockchain technologies and see how a blockchain is  simply
a distributed ledger of transactions which is ?? it's inmutable and the transactions which make up
the blockchain can easily be verified by any participant in a blockchain network

we will then see why ethereum is one of the most widely used blockchain implementations out there
and this is because it is an open blockchain based platform which allows nearly anyone to join the 
network and also support the notion ?off? smart contracts that is contracts which are digital ?nature?
and with the clauses of the contract specified in ?code?

we will then examine how to use aws blockchain templates , automate a lot of the dust around spinning
up on ethereum network on aws , we should use one of these templates to provision our own private network
and once that is done we should develop our own smart contract in order to carry out an election
we should see how these smart contracts are in fact digital contracts which are stored on the ethereum
blockchain and also intereact with it and finally we should see how transactions fees are calculated
in ethereum and cover how these fees are directly proportional to the computational complexity of the
transaction
