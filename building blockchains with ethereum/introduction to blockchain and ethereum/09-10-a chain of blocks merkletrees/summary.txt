how is computed the hash of all the transaction of a block
we use the data structure merkle trees ,if the ledger is represented by a list this problem is o(m)
if it is represented as a tree the problem should be  o(log n)

merkle root hash represent a block

nodes must agree on the order of transactions  is need a trustless algorithm 
like proof of work or proof of stake
