cryptographic hash of the previous block
-timestamp
-transactions

ideal hash function 
-easy compute hash value given any message
-low probabilty of collision , is where two different inpunts have the same hash 
-hard to coverter from hash value to the original input

sha - 256 hash function is always  64 bytes long
